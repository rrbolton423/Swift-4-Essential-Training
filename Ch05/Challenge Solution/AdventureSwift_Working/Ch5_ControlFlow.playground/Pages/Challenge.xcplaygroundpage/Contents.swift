 # Chapter Challenge: Game Conditions

 ### Tasks
 1. Create an optional called **currentWeapon** and assign it a string value
 2. Use optional binding to access **currentWeapon** and handle if it is nil
 3. Create a variable called **currentEXP** and assign it an integer value
 4. Use a `switch` statement with **currentEXP** to evaluate different cases
 5. Create a dictionary called **playerLevels** and assign it player names as keys and level numbers as values
 6. Use a `for-in` loop to iterate over **playerLevels** and print out its key-value pairs in an interpolated string
 7. Add a guard statement inside the `for-in` loop to make sure each player is at least level 1 to proceed
